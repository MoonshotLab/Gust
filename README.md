An interactive pinwheel installation

Multiple arduinos are connected in a master slave pattern using the I2C protocol. The master is responsible for detecting input, determining motor speed, and pinwheel order. The slaves are used to increase the quantity of pwm outputs. 

As a user approaches the installation, they'll use their breath to spin a miniature pinwheel. As the pinwheel turns, they'll discover they're powering an enormous field of giant pinwheels with this same breath.
